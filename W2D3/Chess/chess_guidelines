Phase 3 

- write piece class
- Return an array of places a piece can move to in the piece class
- sub classes are required since some pieces move in different ways
- make modules for slideable and stepable 
- slidable can implement moves but it needs to know what directions a piece can move in
(diagonal, horizontally, veritcally or both)
- Classes that include the slideable module (Bishop/Rook/Queen)
will need a move_dirs, which moves will use.


Sliding pieces (Bishop/Rook/Queen)
Stepping pieces (Knight/King)
Null pieces (occupy the 'empty' spaces)
Pawns (we'll do this class last)




Board

- should hold 2 dimensional array
-  each position holds a moving piece or null piece (null piece inherits from piece)
-  Create an empty piece class
- initialize the board with instances of piece in locations where
Queen, Rook, Knight etc. will start and nil where 
NullPiece will start

-Board class should have a move_piece(start_pos,end_pos) method
that updates the 2d grid and also the moved pieces position
 
 - raise an exception if:

 1.there is no piece at start_pos or
 2.the piece cannot move to end_pos.



 Phase 2

 -write a display class to handle your rendering, 
 Display class should access the board

 - an instance of cursor initialzes with a cursor pos 
 and an instance of Board
 -display will render the square  at @cursor_pos in a different color

 - In display.rb, require cursor.rb and set the instance variable @curstor
 to Cursor.new([0,0],board)

 - read_char handles console input
 - fil in handle_key(key) method, use a 
 case statement that switches on the value 
 of the key. #handle_key(key) will 
 a) return the @cursor_Pos 
 In case of :return of :space 

 b) call update_pos with mov difference from MOVES and return nil
 (in case of :left,:right,:up,:down) 

 c)exit from the terminal process
